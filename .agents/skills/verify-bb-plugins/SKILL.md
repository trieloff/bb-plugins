# Verify bb plugins

Prove the changed user path in the pinned bb app. Static checks support this proof. They do not replace it.

## Launch

Start the repository dev loop before the first plugin edit. The package alias
calls `bb-kit dev-instance workspace --watch`. Leave it running.

```bash
env -u BB_KIT_DEV_NAME -u BB_KIT_DEV_SOURCE bun run dev
```

Clearing the previous run's instance selector keeps the watcher on the workspace
instance. Reuse an existing workspace watcher instead of starting a duplicate.

Create one run ID. The helper starts a bb runtime for this run alone: it borrows
the workspace instance's checkout, comes up on its own ports and its own data
directory, installs the workspace plugins into it, and opens one browser
session with bb Monokai, Dark mode, and the GTD sidebar explicitly selected. Runs do not share a bb, so several can be in flight at once.

```bash
RUN_ID="verify-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
.agents/skills/verify-bb-plugins/scripts/control launch "$RUN_ID"
source ".scratch/verify-bb-plugins/runs/$RUN_ID/run.env"
```

Wait until launch exits and `run.env` exists. Starting the runtime is seconds,
but installing the plugins into its empty bb can take more than one tool yield.
A first-ever workspace instance clones and installs bb, which is minutes.

The helper prints the app URL, the runtime name, the instance whose checkout it
borrowed, the browser session, and the evidence directory. Use those values for
the whole run. Launch checks the selected appearance controls, loaded Monokai
styles, and the rendered GTD project selector before reporting success.

For CLI actions, use `"$BB_CLI"` from `run.env`. It is this run's routed bb
executable. `bb-kit dev-instance exec "$BB_KIT_DEV_NAME" -- <bb arguments>`
also selects this runtime. Do not put a second `bb` after `--`.

## Doctor

Run the doctor before browser work and after unexpected behavior.

```bash
.agents/skills/verify-bb-plugins/scripts/control doctor
```

The doctor checks this run's runtime, its isolated data directory, every workspace
plugin, and the bb Monokai theme. Launch disables bb's built-in `inline-vis` in
this runtime because Kitchen Sink owns the same directive. Doctor rejects that
duplicate if it is enabled again. Fix a failed check before driving the UI.

## Drive

Read [the feature map](features/README.md). Open only the feature file for the changed path.

Load the current browser command reference before the first browser command.

```bash
agent-browser skills get core --full
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" set viewport 1728 1117 2
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" open "$BB_APP_URL"
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" wait --text "New thread"
```

Launch already configures the browser appearance and viewport. If you create a
replacement session, run `bash scripts/dev-browser-appearance "$BROWSER_SESSION" "$BB_APP_URL"`
before testing. Set the viewport before the first `open`. A fresh session renders at device pixel ratio 1 on a 1280x577 window, which rasterises 16px icons onto 16 physical pixels and crops the app. The 2x setting persists for the session across `open` and `reload`.

Drive the same controls a user drives. Prefer roles, labels, and visible text. Use CSS only for stable plugin contracts listed in the feature file.

Wait for the destination control after navigation. A successful click can return
before the next page is ready. After a failed drive, run `doctor` again and reset
the page to a known state before retrying.

## Evidence

Capture the initial state, the action result, and the final URL. Use a DOM snapshot when the visible result depends on structure.

```bash
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" screenshot body "$ARTIFACT_DIR/01-initial.png"
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" screenshot body "$ARTIFACT_DIR/02-result.png"
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" get url > "$ARTIFACT_DIR/result-url.txt"
agent-browser --session "$BROWSER_SESSION" snapshot > "$ARTIFACT_DIR/result-snapshot.txt"
```

Inspect each screenshot. Do not treat a successful command as visual proof.

Record the expected result and the observed result in `$ARTIFACT_DIR/result.md`. State the tested feature, bb URL, and run ID.

## Cleanup

Close only the session created for this run. Keep the evidence directory.

```bash
.agents/skills/verify-bb-plugins/scripts/control cleanup "$RUN_ID"
test -d "$ARTIFACT_DIR"
```

Confirm this run's app URL no longer answers and its named browser session is
absent from `agent-browser session list`. A successful destroy message alone
does not prove every process stopped. If a listener survives, record its process
identity and match it to this run's data directory before cleaning up the residue.

Do not stop the repository watcher. Do not reload the live desktop app.

## Helpers

- `scripts/control launch <run-id>` starts this run's bb runtime and prepares it.
- `scripts/control doctor [run-id]` checks this run's runtime. It reads `RUN_ID` when you omit one.
- `scripts/control cleanup <run-id>` closes the browser session and destroys the runtime. The evidence stays.
- `features/README.md` maps the representative plugin paths.

## Gotchas

- Always use this run's URL from `run.env`. Every runtime has its own, and it is never the workspace instance's.
- Run `cleanup` even when the run fails. A runtime left running holds three ports and a data directory.
- Open `BB_APP_URL` in the browser. Let the routed `BB_CLI` select the CLI endpoint instead of setting `BB_SERVER_URL` manually.
- Every runtime shares one checkout and one plugin `dist/`. Never load a test change into the desktop app without approval.
- Keep screenshots and snapshots under `.scratch/verify-bb-plugins/runs/<run-id>/evidence/`.
- Do not drive one browser session from concurrent commands. Commands can reset or race the active page.
