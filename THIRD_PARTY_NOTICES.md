# Third-party notices

This repository's own code is [MIT](LICENSE). It also contains code and assets from
the projects below, under their own terms, which follow.

This file covers the **whole repository tree**, published or not. Each published
plugin also carries its own `plugins/<id>/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, scoped to what
that package's npm tarball actually ships — its bundled `dist/` output and its
`assets/` artwork. The per-plugin files are narrower on purpose; they do not replace
this one, and neither replaces a licence that travels with a dependency.

## bb — `get-bb/bb`

Three separate bodies of code arrive from bb, all under the MIT licence:

| What                                                                                                                                         | Where                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| The whole **GTD Sidebar** plugin, forked from `examples/plugins/t3sidebar` at commit `f13c2d35f96540012b305f3b555839b30e1b6163` (2026-08-07) | `plugins/gtd-sidebar/`                      |
| Provider brand-mark **geometry**, lifted from bb's own icon components                                                                       | `plugins/gtd-sidebar/lib/provider-marks.ts` |
| shadcn/ui-derived components, vendored through bb's own plugin component registry and marked `/* shadcn/ui-derived */`                       | `plugins/**/components/ui/`                 |

## Trademarks and brand marks

Two files carry third-party brand artwork. **No licence above grants trademark
rights**, and none is claimed here. Both are used only to identify the product a
user has chosen to install, which is nominative use.

| Mark                                                 | Where                                                                                                                  | Owner                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Amp                                                  | `plugins/amp/assets/*.svg` and `plugins/amp/src/amp-brand.ts`, used for plugin branding and rendered in the Orb banner | Sourcegraph             |
| OpenAI, Claude, Cursor, Grok, opencode, Pi, oh-my-pi | `plugins/gtd-sidebar/lib/provider-marks.ts`                                                                            | their respective owners |

In bb provider chrome, a host-served logo always takes precedence over vendored
geometry and is rendered as a muted silhouette. The Amp Orb banner uses the
vendored Amp mark as an Amp-red status accent.

## `agentation`

`plugins/agentation` bundles `agentation` into `dist/app.js`, from a **modified
copy** kept at `plugins/agentation/vendor/agentation`. The changes are recorded
in `plugins/agentation/vendor/agentation.patch` and explained in that
directory's README; upstream's own `LICENSE` and `README.md` travel with the
copy unchanged.

That package uses the [**PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0**](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/),
not MIT. It permits use, modification, and redistribution, but not use in a
product or service that competes with the software or another product from its
authors. A distribution must include a copy of that licence; it is included both
beside the vendored copy and in `plugins/agentation/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Fonts

The documentation screenshot renderer loads **Inter** and **IBM Plex Mono** from
the `@fontsource-variable/inter` and `@fontsource/ibm-plex-mono` development
dependencies. Both fonts use the SIL Open Font License 1.1. Their binaries are
not committed to this repository or shipped in a plugin tarball.
