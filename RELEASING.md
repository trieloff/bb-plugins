# Releasing plugins

Release Please keeps one release pull request open for each publishable plugin.
Merging one release pull request creates that plugin's `<plugin-id>/v<version>`
tag and GitHub Release. The release workflow then publishes the scoped npm
package and its unscoped mirror.

## Declare a release

Release Please reads Conventional Commits that touch a plugin directory:

- `fix(<plugin-id>): ...` creates a patch release.
- `feat(<plugin-id>): ...` creates a minor release.
- Add `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for a major release.
- `chore`, `docs`, `test`, and root-only changes create no plugin release.

The scope helps readers, but the changed path selects the plugin. A commit that
touches several publishable plugin directories can update several independent
release pull requests.

## Migration floor

`.github/release-please-config.json` sets `bootstrap-sha` to the migration cutover.
This prevents commits already handled by Changesets from appearing in the
initial changelogs. Release Please ignores this floor after it can find the
new release history, so it does not replay those first commits later.

The migration includes one `fix(amp)` commit after the floor. It preserves the
pending bb 0.40 patch as Amp 0.4.2.

## Publication

The release workflow uses Release Please's `paths_released` output as its npm
publish matrix. Each released package is built and published directly from its
workspace directory. Plugins also publish their established unscoped mirror.
