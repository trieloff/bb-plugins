# Third-party notices

`@smsunarto/bb-plugin-amp` is published as bundles. The build inlines its
dependencies into `dist/server.js`, `dist/host.js`, and `dist/app.css`, and
the package also ships third-party icon artwork in `assets/`. This file lists
every third-party work the package distributes, with the required notices.

The plugin's own code is MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Not listed here, because this package does **not** ship their code: React and
the bb plugin SDK, which the bb host supplies at run time through its plugin
runtime shim; and the Amp CLI itself, which the plugin locates on your machine
through `AMP_CLI_PATH` and never bundles.
