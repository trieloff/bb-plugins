# Docs

Docs is a filesystem-first document library for bb. Documents remain ordinary
Markdown, HTML, and asset files while the plugin adds nested navigation,
multi-host vaults, rich editing, images, sandboxed HTML, automation, chat
mentions, and links that open inside a thread.

This fork is published as `@smsunarto/bb-plugin-docs` with plugin ID `docs`.
It keeps upstream's Tiptap editor and proposal review, and adds the smsunarto
Monokai reading theme, a [Pierre Trees](https://trees.software/) explorer,
and hidden human-authored folders. bb's built-in Docs (`simple-notes`) claims
the same `bb docs` command, so installing the fork disables `simple-notes` when
it is enabled.

Forked from [`get-bb/bb/plugins/docs`](https://github.com/get-bb/bb/tree/desktop-v0.44.0/plugins/docs).
Last synced with `desktop-v0.44.0` (`0baa605b32a00619c1d7e3f32be6553ebcf8244a`)
from base `5c5123d5d94cf673a1dea1bcfaf386c8cd32d392` on 2026-09-26. Shared UI
under `components/`, `hooks/`, and `lib/` is vendored from the bb plugin
registry at that tag (`components.json`).

## Features

- **Vaults on connected hosts:** each vault is a named `{ hostId, rootPath }`
  pair. A new installation starts with a Personal vault at `~/Notes` on the
  server machine. Manage local and remote vaults from the Docs panel. When
  bb removes a host, its vaults and their proposals are deleted, and the
  Personal vault is recreated if no vault remains.
- **Nested folders:** the resizable right sidebar recursively displays folders,
  Markdown documents, MDX files, and HTML pages. It can be collapsed, and
  search stays hidden until requested. The Pierre Trees explorer supports
  keyboard navigation, context actions, and drag-and-drop moves between
  folders. Human-authored hidden folders such as `.agents`, `.claude`, and
  `.cursor` are included. Version-control metadata, dependency trees, caches,
  build outputs, and temporary workspaces stay excluded. MDX files, including
  `.canvas.mdx`, open through bb's file opener (Canvas) rather than Docs.
- **Safe host-routed operations:** all list/read/write/mkdir/move/remove calls
  go through `bb.sdk.files` with an explicit vault root. Saves retain SHA-256
  compare-and-swap conflict handling. Local vaults use native filesystem
  watching for immediate UI refreshes; remote or unwatchable vaults fall back
  to polling.
- **Default Markdown editor:** Docs registers for `.md` and `.markdown`
  files, so it can be selected under Settings → File openers or chosen from a
  file link's Open with menu. Workspace, absolute host, and thread-storage
  files retain compare-and-swap saves even when they are outside a Docs vault.
  Clean open files reload after external writes. Pending edits keep conflict
  protection.
- **YAML frontmatter:** an opening fenced block that parses as a YAML mapping
  supplies the document title when it has a string `title`, stays out of the
  rendered body and search preview, and is preserved byte-for-byte when the
  rich editor saves body changes. A document that opens with a thematic break
  instead keeps that content in the editor. Docs leaves the filename unchanged
  on save when frontmatter sets the title; otherwise the H1 still drives it.
- **Tables:** GitHub-flavored Markdown tables render as editable cells. Use Tab
  and Shift+Tab to move between cells (Tab from the final cell adds a row), and
  drag column boundaries to resize them. Saves remain portable Markdown.
- **Images:** paste or drop PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, or SVG files into a document.
  Attachments are stored beside it under `_attachments/` and serialized as
  portable relative Markdown image links.
- **Embedded HTML:** a Markdown block directive renders a sibling HTML file in
  an opaque-origin iframe:

  ```md
  ::html{src="./report.html" height="480"}
  ```

  Heights are clamped from 120–1200 pixels. The source remains a Markdown
  directive when saved.

- **Full HTML pages:** `.html` and `.htm` files appear in the vault tree and
  open as full-pane previews.
- **Relative assets:** images and HTML use short-lived, path-shaped preview
  leases. Relative styles, scripts, modules, images, and data files stay under
  the selected vault root. HTML responses use `sandbox allow-scripts`, and the
  iframe never receives `allow-same-origin`.
- **Chat mentions:** `@` searches every vault's titles, previews, filenames,
  and folders. Searches share in-flight reads and cache summaries for up to
  ten seconds. Docs edits and local filesystem notifications invalidate the
  affected vault's cache. A selected document resolves to its latest content
  at send time.
- **Thread documents:** Markdown cards are editable and autosave directly in
  the timeline. Open in tab opens the same document with shared editing state.
  Pending agent proposals show live inline additions and deletions, with compact
  Accept, Reject, Undo, and Redo controls. Ask for changes stays available and
  adds an `Update` prompt with a Docs mention to the existing composer draft.
  Ordinary user edits do not show a diff. HTML cards open a sandboxed preview.

  ```md
  ::docs{vault="personal" path="plans/release-plan.md" title="Release plan"}
  ```

## Agent skill

The plugin ships `skills/docs/SKILL.md`. Installed agents are taught to use the
Docs CLI, understand that a Docs `@`-mention is user-provided document context,
store plans and HTML artifacts in a vault when asked, and return `::docs` links
that the user can open in bb.

## CLI

The plugin registers the agent-discoverable `bb docs` command:

```sh
bb docs vaults --json
bb docs vault-add Work /home/me/work-docs host_workstation
bb docs list --vault personal --json
bb docs read projects/plan.md --vault personal
bb docs pull projects/plan.md --vault personal --into ./docs-work
# Edit ./docs-work/projects/plan.md with an ordinary editor or agent file tool.
bb docs status ./docs-work --diff
bb docs push ./docs-work

bb docs pull projects --folder --vault personal --into ./docs-work
bb docs pull --all --vault personal --into ./docs-work
bb docs push ./docs-work --dry-run --diff
bb docs push ./docs-work --delete
```

### Sync workspace contract

- **Layout and identity:** the destination keeps exact vault-relative paths
  beneath one workspace root and stores a versioned `.bb-docs-state.json`
  manifest at that root. Manifest entries map `vault id + remote path` to a
  local path and retain the pulled SHA-256, byte size, content encoding, MIME
  type, and modification time. A single-file pull still keeps its vault path,
  so every scope has the same layout.
- **Collisions:** exact relative paths are the stable identity. Pull rejects
  case-folding collisions before writing, rather than choosing an unstable
  filename on case-insensitive filesystems. Hidden vault path segments are not
  part of the accessible Docs contract and are skipped.
- **Fidelity and assets:** every accessible file in a folder or vault scope is
  included, not only Markdown/HTML. UTF-8 stays UTF-8; other bytes use base64
  across the host RPC and are written back byte-for-byte. Empty accessible
  directories are retained.
- **Safe refresh:** pulling into an existing valid workspace performs a
  three-way comparison between manifest, local bytes, and current vault bytes.
  It updates only locally unchanged files, preserves local-only edits and new
  files, removes remotely deleted files only when their local copy is
  unchanged, removes remotely deleted empty directories only when they are
  still empty locally, and stops before any write on a true conflict.
- **Safe push:** push preflights the entire scope. Existing writes use their
  pulled SHA-256 as a compare-and-swap guard and new files use create-only
  writes. Remote additions, remote deletions, or concurrent edits are
  conflicts until the workspace is pulled and reconciled.
- **Deletion:** missing local files and empty directories produce warnings and
  are ignored by default. `--delete` removes only paths tracked by the manifest;
  files additionally require the remote SHA to still match, and directories
  must still be empty. A pulled folder root is retained; pull its parent or the
  whole vault to delete that directory. The CLI never infers deletion from an
  untracked path.
- **Dry run and diff:** `status` and `push --dry-run` make no remote changes.
  `--diff` adds a compact unified diff for changed UTF-8 files; binary changes
  remain path summaries. `status` exits 4 when actionable changes/warnings are
  present.
- **Atomicity and recovery:** all conflicts are found before mutation, but
  host filesystems do not provide a cross-file transaction. A daemon or I/O
  failure can therefore yield `partial`; successful remote CAS writes are not
  rolled back. The old manifest remains in place, so rerunning `status`, then
  `pull` or `push`, reconciles already-applied bytes without clobbering them.
  The manifest itself is CAS-written last. Deletes receive a final hash check
  immediately before removal, but the underlying remove primitive is not
  transactional with that check. A compare-and-swap race before any mutation
  is reported as `conflict`; it becomes `partial` only if another mutation was
  already applied.
- **Malformed state:** invalid, duplicate, out-of-scope, or wrong-version
  manifests fail closed. Move the directory aside for inspection and pull into
  a clean destination; the CLI never guesses or repairs identity metadata.
- **Workspace host:** agent invocations resolve the workspace host from the
  current thread environment. Standalone multi-host callers can pass
  `--workspace-host <id>`; omission intentionally targets the server machine.

Human output is concise and `--json` returns a stable structured result on
success; a failure adds the `{"ok":false,"error":{"code","message","hint"?}}`
envelope on stdout and keeps the readable text on stderr. Exit codes are 0
success/no-op, 1 validation or operational/partial failure, 2 usage error, 3
stale/conflict, and 4 `status` found changes or ignored deletions. Options are
command-specific; an unknown command, an option not shown in a command's usage,
and a stray argument are all rejected before any mutation, with the nearest
declared name suggested. `bb docs --help` lists the commands and
`bb docs <command> --help` prints that command's arguments, options, and rules.

The legacy `write`, `mkdir`, `move`, and `remove` CLI commands remain for one
backward-compatibility window and emit a deprecation warning. New agent
workflows must use pull/edit/push. UI/RPC editing remains supported and keeps
its existing compare-and-swap behavior.

## Token-authenticated HTTP API

The fork's plugin ID is `docs`. Generate or inspect its token with
`bb plugin token docs`, then send it in
`x-bb-plugin-token` to these JSON endpoints:

```text
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/list
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/read
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/write
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/mkdir
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/move
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/remove
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/sync/snapshot
POST /api/v1/plugins/docs/http/sync/apply
```

Example request body:

```json
{ "vaultId": "personal", "path": "projects/plan.md" }
```

The API, CLI, UI RPC, and mention provider share the same path parser and vault
service. `sync/snapshot` returns a validated file/folder/all snapshot including
content and version metadata. `sync/apply` requires `writes`, `deletes`,
`directories`, `deleteDirectories`, and `dryRun`; it rejects colliding paths,
preflights every expected SHA, reports only directories actually created, and
returns `applied`, `conflict`, or `partial`. Callers must keep local workspace
state client-side.

## Install

```sh
bb plugin install /path/to/bb-plugins/plugins/docs --yes
bb plugin reload docs
```

## Inline editing and proposed revisions

Markdown document cards support inline editing and opening the same file in a
Docs tab. An agent can propose a complete revision without modifying the file:

```sh
bb docs read letter.md --vault personal --json
bb docs proposal letter.md --vault personal --json
bb docs propose letter.md --vault personal --file ./candidate.md --expected-sha256 HASH --version none --json
```

Use the returned proposal version instead of `none` when replacing a previous
proposal. `--file` is read on the thread's workspace host; `--workspace-host`
overrides that host. The expected hash must come from the document used to
write the candidate. Every proposal mutation checks its version, including
replacement after rejection, so a delayed response cannot restore stale work.

`bb docs proposal-update letter.md --version N --content MARKDOWN` updates only
the pending candidate. `bb docs accept|reject|undo|redo letter.md --version N`
performs the same actions as the card. All accept `--vault` and `--json`.
Accept saves only when the original file hash still matches. Reject leaves the
file alone. Undo after rejection restores the pending proposal; undo after
acceptance restores the original file if nobody has changed it. Redo then
reopens the proposal for review. There is one persisted proposal per document,
not a revision history. Failed writes leave the candidate available to retry.
Proposals follow file and folder moves made through Docs and are cleared when
their document, folder, or vault is removed.

The RPC equivalents are `readProposal`, `proposeNote`, `updateProposal`, and
`resolveProposal`. `proposal-changed` signals carry `vaultId`, `path`, and
`version`. `vault-changed` can include `path` for a single-document change and
`proposalOnly: true` when the matching `proposal-changed` signal covers it.
Events without a path still invalidate the whole vault (or all vaults when
`vaultId` is absent), including external filesystem changes. Existing file
read, save, and sync APIs remain supported.
