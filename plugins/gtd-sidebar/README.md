# GTD Sidebar

**A thread list organized by who can act next.**

</div>

GTD Sidebar replaces the scrolling thread list in bb's left sidebar with an inbox.

Active threads split into **Next Action** when the user can act and **Waiting** while
the agent works. Every section shows the most recently updated thread first.

You clear the list with two email verbs: **snooze** a thread until a wake time, or
**settle** it when you are done. Settle archives the thread in bb, and bb's Undo toast
brings it back. The Snoozed and Settled shelves collapse to one counted header each.

## Install

**From the marketplace** — add this repository once, then install by name:

```sh
bb marketplace add git:github.com/smsunarto/bb-plugins
bb plugin install gtd-sidebar
```

bb resolves the newest `gtd-sidebar/vX.Y.Z` tag and builds the plugin from it against
your bb, so the bundle always matches the host it runs on. `bb plugin update
gtd-sidebar` follows the same release line. If another marketplace you have added
publishes a `gtd-sidebar`, spell it `gtd-sidebar@smsunarto`.

**From source** — clone the repo and install the plugin as a local path
source. This is also how you install a change that is not released yet:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smsunarto/bb-plugins.git
cd bb-plugins
bun install
bun run --filter '@smsunarto/bb-plugin-gtd-sidebar' build
bb plugin install ./plugins/gtd-sidebar
```

The source path needs Bun and the `bb` CLI. It installs the plugin as a **local
path source**, so bb reads the files in place: edit, rebuild, reload, with no
reinstall.

## Requirements

- bb 0.40+
- Sidebar organization needs nothing else.
- Thread naming needs an existing Codex login on bb's primary host.

## Usage

Installing does not change your sidebar by itself. Open **Settings → Appearance →
Sidebar** and choose **GTD Sidebar (inbox)**.

bb's own list stays the default, and comes back the moment you switch away or
disable the plugin.

### Active and parked sections

- **Pinned** — the user's explicit priority, kept in its own shelf above active work.
- **Next Action** — the agent turn is done, an interaction needs input, or the thread is otherwise quiet.
- **Waiting** — foreground or background agent work is live, in the thread or in any of its subthreads. A family moves back to Next Action only when one of its threads asks you something.
- **Snoozed** — hidden until the wake time you chose. A snoozed thread comes back early if it starts working or asks you something.

Pinned follows bb's own pinned order — the same order the built-in sidebar
drags by — so a pin moved there lands in the same place here. Every other
section orders threads by when they arrived on it, newest first, and a
thread keeps its spot while it stays put: a turn starting, a read, a rename, or
child activity never reshuffles it. Only a shelf change moves it, to the top of
the new shelf. Snoozed sorts by the moment you snoozed and Settled by the
moment it settled; expand Snoozed to see that order.

An empty section disappears. A pending interaction stays in **Next Action** even if
background work is also live, because the user can act now.

### Project groups

Once threads from two or more projects are in view, every shelf splits into
project groups: a header naming the project, then that project's threads. The
header folds the group; a folded header shows `needs-you / total` while
something inside asks for you, and the total alone otherwise. Hovering the
header shows a **+** that opens the project's new-thread screen. Shelf and
group headers stay pinned while their rows scroll.

Groups follow bb's project order in every shelf, with your personal project
last. Right-click a group header for **Move up** and **Move down**: they reorder
the project in bb itself, so every shelf agrees and bb's own project lists
follow along.

The shelf still comes first: the same project appears under Next Action and
under Waiting when it has work in both, and folding it in one shelf leaves it
open in the other. A subthread stays under its parent even when it belongs to another
project. With a single project in view there are no headers at all.

A thread's title never shares its line with a project name. Remote threads
lead with a globe in their machine's colour instead.

### Cards

Two lines: the title in bold when unread and a status slot, then the project, the
branch, activity counts, PR number, and the agent (which you can turn off — see
[Configuration](#configuration)). The status slot shows what the
thread needs — failed, waiting on you, working, or finished while you were away —
and its age (`now`, `7m`, `3d`) when it needs nothing. Hovering swaps that slot for
the park buttons.

### A working thread can never be snoozed

Workflows, background agents, background commands, plan mode, and goals all count as
live work. Any of them blocks snoozing and wakes a snoozed thread, so running work is
never hidden.

### Snoozing

The hover button snoozes until **09:00 tomorrow**.

### Settling

The check button, the card menu, and the **GTD Sidebar: settle thread** row in bb's
quick palette all archive the thread in bb. bb's Undo toast brings it back. Settling
the open thread moves you to the next row in its section.

The **Settled** shelf lists every thread archived in the last 24 hours, whether it was
settled here or archived from bb's own sidebar. The hover button un-settles it, which
unarchives the thread in bb. After a day a thread stops being drawn on the shelf and
stays in bb's archive.

### Child threads

A child sits under its parent with a disclosure chevron. Folding a family uses bb's
own `sidebar.collapsedThreads` preference, so a family folded here is folded in bb's
built-in sidebar too, and the fold survives a reload. Folded project groups stay
session state.

### Thread names

A root thread gets a GTD-generated name on its first user prompt, replacing any
initial title supplied by BB. First-request inference can only generate a new
title, never keep BB's title. Later prompts keep the existing title unless you clearly start completely different work. Follow-ups,
corrections, tests, debugging, screenshots, commits, and shipping for the same
task keep its title. When the task change is uncertain, the title stays unchanged.
Queued prompts are checked when dispatched. Agent replies and turn completion do
not trigger naming. New titles are plain text with no activity emoji. Prefixes
and other project formatting come only from your naming rules. Existing titles
are preserved exactly when the decision is to keep them.

The plugin sends a tool-free prompt to GPT-5.6-Luna with reasoning disabled and
asks for a keep-or-rename decision with the complete title. The first request, an
untitled thread, and explicit regeneration use a generation prompt that can only
rename. Later requests use a review prompt that sees the current title and may
keep it, and a keep decision does not write to the thread. Both prompts carry the
latest request, the original request, up to three recent requests, and your
project naming rules. A transient failure retries once with GPT-5.4-Mini, and each
attempt has a five-second deadline. Logs record timing, never the prompt.

Run the **configure-gtd-naming** skill to create or update
`.agents/GTD_NAMING.md` in your project. The skill inspects the project, chooses
compact naming rules, and writes the file. Scopes are configured there instead
of inferred automatically for every title. You can also edit the file directly:

```md
Use [GTD] for sidebar work and [Vimium] for keyboard navigation.
For work spanning both, use [GTD + Vimium]. Otherwise use a plain title.
Keep prefixes out of the task text.
```

The plugin reads the file from the active workspace on every naming request and
injects up to 500 characters of whole lines. The setup skill keeps the entire file
within that budget. An empty or non-UTF-8 file uses default instructions.

To replace a title by hand, run `bb gtd-sidebar rename [<threadId>]`. The command
uses the current thread when you omit the id. Explicit regeneration can replace a title even when
the task has not changed.

### The rest

- A project scope picker — the one control the plugin adds.
- Right-click a row to settle, snooze, pin, or delete it.
- On a phone, hold a row for half a second (iOS's own long-press timing) for the same
  menu, drawn as an iOS-style frosted sheet. Menu taps play a haptic on iOS.
- Drag a card to a split pane, or Cmd/Ctrl-click to open one.
- bb's search, its thread shortcuts, and modifier-click split-open all keep working.

## Configuration

Two settings, in **Settings → Plugins → GTD Sidebar**:

- **Automatically name threads** — on. Turn it off to stop automatic title
  generation and task-change checks. Manual naming from the CLI still works.

- **Show the agent icon on each card** — on. Turn it off to drop the trailing agent
  glyph and give the branch that space back. Every card follows it together, so the
  meta line keeps a straight right edge either way.

A snooze wakes the thread at 09:00 the next day in your local timezone. That is
not a setting.

## Troubleshooting

**My sidebar looks the same after installing.** Choose GTD Sidebar in Settings →
Appearance → Sidebar. Installing alone changes nothing.

**A snoozed thread came back early.** That is the design: a snoozed thread wakes when
it starts working or asks you a question.

**Uninstalling left data behind.** Snoozes live in the plugin's own database,
which bb removes with the plugin. Earlier versions also cached them in the
browser's `localStorage` under `gtd-sidebar:v1:*`. This version removes those
entries the first time it loads, so nothing stays behind.

## Credits

Forked from bb's own example, and released as `t3sidebar` until 0.3.0. bb keys a
plugin by its id, so the renamed plugin installs as a separate one: install
`gtd-sidebar`, then uninstall `t3sidebar`. Snoozes do not carry over — they live in
the old plugin's database and go with it.

Thread naming adapts the lifecycle design from
[`suiramdev/bb-plugin-thread-namer`](https://github.com/suiramdev/bb-plugin-thread-namer)
at commit `023d1229db020330a940e4bff060e23bd4b278d8`.

The provider brand marks are vendored SVG geometry from `get-bb/bb` and depict
third-party brands. A host-served logo always wins over them, rendered as a muted
silhouette rather than in brand color — by design.

## Develop from source
