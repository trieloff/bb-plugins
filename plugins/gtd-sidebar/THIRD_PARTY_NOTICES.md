## ios-haptics — `tijnjh/ios-haptics`

MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 tijn.

`hapticTrigger` and `isIos` from v3.1.1 are copied verbatim into
`lib/ios-haptics.ts` and compiled into `dist/app.js`. Vendored rather than
depended on so the switch overlay can be reasoned about next to the menu it
serves.

## @uidotdev/usehooks

MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023 ui.dev.

`useLongPress` times the compact row's long press. Compiled into `dist/app.js`.

## Not shipped here

React, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `@radix-ui/react-select`,
`@radix-ui/react-context-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` and `@get-bb/plugin-sdk`
are **not** bundled in this package. The bb app provides them at run time, so their
licences travel with bb, not with this plugin.

## Trademarks and brand marks

The provider glyphs drawn from `lib/provider-marks.ts` depict third-party brands:
OpenAI, Claude, Pi, Cursor, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, opencode and oh-my-pi. Each mark
belongs to its owner.

**No licence above grants trademark rights**, and none is claimed here. The marks
identify the agent a user has chosen to run, which is nominative use. A host-served
logo always takes precedence over the vendored geometry and is drawn as a muted
silhouette rather than in brand color.
