            and a false empty state is worse than a blank moment. It comes
            after the error branch so a failed thread query still says so, and
            it is reached whenever nothing seeded the shelves: a first-ever
            run, a cleared origin, or any browser with web storage switched
            off or partitioned, where the seed misses on every page load.
            `shelvesReady`'s own deadline is behind all of them.

            There is deliberately no second gate for the settled rows. The
            shelves are ready by then, so waiting on the slower read would blank
            pinned and active sections, and snoozed — every one of them already
            in hand — to protect one line at the bottom, and any wait bounded
            enough not to hang the sidebar ends by opening on the same false
            empty state it postponed. `shelvedTotal` counts the settled rows
            still in flight instead. That closes this branch outright on a
            cache HIT: the rows are already there, so a user whose threads are
            all settled has a non-zero total from the first frame. On a MISS it
            only shortens the exposure — there is nothing to count, so once
            `SHELF_GATE_MS` gives up on a `listLifecycle` still in flight the
            branch is reachable again and says "No threads yet" until that read
            lands. Nothing short of the seed can close it there: on a cold
            origin the plugin knows nothing about this user at all. */}

   * whose threads are all settled that they have none.
