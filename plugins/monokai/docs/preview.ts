/**
 * A sample for eyeballing the bb Monokai code theme. Nothing imports it; it
 * exists to be looked at, in the diff viewer or the file preview.
 *
 * What each hue should land on, measured against this file:
 *   grey    #beb899  commentary (this block)
 *   pink    #fe5d86  machinery — import, from, export, and operators
 *   cyan    #51dae9  structure — storage keywords and type names, null among them
 *   green   #9ddd54  callables — function and method names, declared or called
 *   yellow  #f7d05c  strings, and the body of a regex
 *   purple  #a895fe  constants — numbers, booleans, regex character classes
 *   orange  #ff8342  parameters, type parameters, and their annotations
 *   white   #e3e3dd  everything else — variables, enum members, punctuation
 *
 * A diff has no language server behind it, so this is the TextMate layer alone.
 * An editor colours some of these from semantic tokens instead and will differ.
