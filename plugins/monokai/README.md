bb draws itself from CSS custom properties, so a theme is just a stylesheet.
This plugin adds one: **bb Monokai**, a dark palette built on a five-step
grounds ramp, a single off-white text ladder, and one accent that always means
_interactive_.

It reaches past the app chrome: the terminal, the diff viewer, the file tree's
git-status column, inline code, and the syntax tokens inside diffs and file
previews all draw from the same palette rather than keeping bb's defaults.

## Install

**From the marketplace** — add this repository once, then install by name:

```sh
bb marketplace add git:github.com/smsunarto/bb-plugins
bb plugin install monokai
bb theme set plugin:monokai:bb-monokai
```

bb resolves the newest `monokai/vX.Y.Z` tag and builds the plugin from it against
your bb, so the bundle always matches the host it runs on. `bb plugin update
monokai` follows the same release line. If another marketplace you have added
publishes a `monokai`, spell it `monokai@smsunarto`.

**From source** — clone the repo and install the plugin as a local path
source. This is also how you install a change that is not released yet:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smsunarto/bb-plugins.git
cd bb-plugins
bun install
bun run --filter '@smsunarto/bb-plugin-monokai' build
bb plugin install ./plugins/monokai
bb theme set plugin:monokai:bb-monokai
```

The source path needs Bun and the `bb` CLI. It installs the plugin as a **local
path source**, so bb reads the files in place: edit, rebuild, reload, with no
reinstall.

## Usage

Installing the plugin only adds the palette. The `bb theme set` line above is
what selects it. You can also switch in bb under
**Settings → Appearance → Palette**:

Disabling or removing the plugin returns bb to the default palette.

Choose **Inter (Default)** or **SF Pro** under **Settings → bb Monokai → UI
font**. The choice applies to the full interface at desktop and mobile widths.
Code, diffs, and file paths keep the Berkeley Mono stack. The terminal uses
BerkeleyMono Nerd Font Mono at size 13 with 1.4 line height and a #181818
background, matching the Ghostty cursor-monokai setup. A plugin content script applies these settings to existing and new
xterm terminals, including the WebGL renderer, without a BB core update. It
restores the previous typography when Monokai is deselected or unloaded. The
adapter uses guarded React-ref and xterm-addon discovery. If a future BB
version changes those private attachments, it leaves the terminal untouched.

The in-app notification center now uses the same Monokai surfaces and states as
the rest of bb, including its selected row, controls, dividers, and desktop
card. On desktop, transient toasts also use a compact Codex-inspired layout at
the top center of the focused conversation: rounded cards, a subtle border,
quiet icons, and an inline dismiss button. Compact layouts keep bb's native
drawer and toast geometry. Undo, links, dismissal, and stacking keep bb's
existing behavior. This is a theme-only CSS override. Switching palettes
restores bb's placement. Desktop browsers without CSS anchor positioning center
toasts over the viewport instead. Native browser and operating-system banners
from bb's push-notifications plugin are system-owned and cannot be restyled by a
bb theme.

## Requirements

- bb 0.42+. The live UI-font setting uses the app overlay added in bb 0.42.
- bb set to **dark** appearance. The palette only restyles `.dark`; light mode
  keeps bb's defaults.
- Optional: **Berkeley Mono**. It is _not_ bundled. Install it yourself and the
  type stack picks it up. Without it the
  stack falls back to `ui-monospace`, Menlo, then `monospace`. The terminal
  additionally prefers `BerkeleyMono Nerd Font Mono` when present.
- Optional: **SF Pro**. bb uses the Apple system font on Apple platforms. Other
  platforms need SF Pro installed or use the generic sans-serif fallback.

In-flow components composite the same alpha layer over their actual parent.
A field in a card therefore remains distinct without a card-specific color.
Borders clip the fill to the padding box, so two alpha layers do not stack
under the edge. Menus, code, terminals, and explicit solid fallbacks remain
opaque where they must hide content beneath them.

[Cursor measurements and token mapping](docs/alpha-surfaces.md) explain the
reference and how to rerun the browser composition audit.

**One meaning per hue.** A color never does two jobs. Text is one white at four
alphas (100 / 74 / 55 / 30 %), each annotated inline with its measured contrast
ratio against the ground it sits on.

## What it restyles

### Syntax tokens

Token colors are not a CSS surface — Shiki writes an inline style on every span
inside a shadow root. bb 0.38 answers that with a manifest field that picks the
Shiki theme, so the plugin ships one: `themes/bb-monokai-code.json`, the same
TextMate layer as the Cursor Monokai editor theme. One hue per kind — pink machinery, cyan structure, green
callables, yellow literals, purple constants, gray commentary, white for
everything else.

Only the dark side is declared, so light mode keeps bb's `pierre-light`. A
diff has no language server behind it, so this is the TextMate layer alone:
tokens an editor colors from semantic tokens (a plain parameter, a declaration
in bold) stay at their TextMate color here.

## Troubleshooting

**The app still looks the same.** The palette has to be selected. Run
`bb theme set plugin:monokai:bb-monokai`, or pick **bb Monokai** under
**Settings → Appearance → Palette**.

**Only part of the app changed.** Check that bb is in dark appearance. In light
mode the palette contributes fonts only.

**Some surfaces stay off-palette.** CSS cannot reach them:

- **File-type icons.** Their 13 source swatches are declared on `:host`, so all
  48 language icons collapse to a single color.
- **Terminal cursor blink and selection alpha** remain controlled by the host.
- **Mermaid diagrams** keep a hardcoded Inter font. Colors follow the palette
  on the next render.
- **The favicon tint** comes from a fixed list, with no CSS involved.
- **Built-in bb plugin panels** (tasks, docs, github, workflows, memory) ship
  their own bundles with raw scale colors.

## Develop from source

Install from source as shown under [Install](#install). The shipped CSS is
generated from the TypeScript palette and a selector-focused template:

```sh
$EDITOR plugins/monokai/scripts/generate-theme.ts
$EDITOR plugins/monokai/scripts/bb-monokai.template.css
bun run --filter '@smsunarto/bb-plugin-monokai' generate:theme
bun run --filter '@smsunarto/bb-plugin-monokai' check
bb plugin reload monokai
```

The palette in `generate-theme.ts` is the only color registry: every surface
takes a role name, never a hex. `themes/bb-monokai.css` and
`themes/bb-monokai-code.json` are generated; do not edit them. The syntax
layer's scope map lives in `scripts/code-theme-rules.json`, also in role names.

The generator rejects stale output, unknown roles, off-contract colors, missing
tokens, wrong role mappings, illegible pairs, and a chrome-only role on a
syntax token. The plugin build runs that check automatically.

Re-apply with `bb theme set plugin:monokai:bb-monokai` if the palette does not
refresh.

To review the palette contract outside bb, start its local Storybook:

```sh
bun run --filter '@smsunarto/bb-plugin-monokai' storybook
```

The catalog imports the generated theme stylesheet, so regeneration updates
the stories without a second token source. It previews the palette and
component states; live bb remains the integration check for shadow-DOM
surfaces and host styles.
